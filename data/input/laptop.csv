Introducing the 8th-Gen ROG Strix Scar Edition
The new ROG Strix Scar Edition is built for the next generation of gamers looking to take their game to the next level.
It’s built for eSports and AAA titles thanks to a powerful Intel Core i7 processor, GTX graphics, and a high refresh rate gaming display.
The 8th-Generation Scar Edition brings several refinements to the series, including:
an AURA SYNC RGB keyboard and 12V fans for improved thermal performance.
Meet the new STRIX Scar Edition Gamers Notebook
High Refresh Rate Gaming Display  
A hallmark of the Strix Scar Edition Series is its high refresh rate displays (including both 120Hz and 144Hz variants).

ROG G703 is a beast of a gaming laptop that has the power to take on today’s gaming desktops, thanks to its factory-overclocked 8th Generation Intel® Core™ i7 processor and NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1070 graphics. G703 is the key that unlocks supreme levels of gaming, so you can play AAA games on Ultra graphics settings without compromises. Continually pushing the envelope, ROG has torn up the gaming laptop blueprint, becoming the first to integrate an ultra-responsive IPS-level 144Hz display with a 3ms response time into its laptops. G703 features HyperDrive Extreme storage, which uses exclusive technology to combine three NVMe PCI Express® (PCIe®) SSDs in RAID 0 configuration for read speeds of up to 8700MB/s, so games load up in a blink of an eye.
Performance, Redefined
Simply saying that G703 has gaming desktop levels of performance would be an understatement. It’s powered by a factory-overclocked Intel Core i7-8750H that’s capable of hitting an incredible 4.1GHz — surpassing base speed by more than 10%! Similarly, its NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU and 8GB of GDDR5 VRAM are factory-overclocked as well, and can reach speeds of up to 1683MHz! This graphics prowess lets you enjoy the latest AAA titles at their maxed-out settings for immersive gaming experiences. The ROG-exclusive Gaming Center puts all this performance at your fingertips, with an intuitive dashboard that lets you push G703 to its limits with a mouse click.
HYPERDRIVE EXTREME — WORLD’S FASTEST RAID 0 STORAGE IN A LAPTOP
HyperDrive Extreme uses exclusive technology to combine up to three NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs to provide G703 with the world’s fastest RAID 0 storage available in a gaming laptop — so your games load up faster. Having two out of the three SSDs directly connected to the CPU helps avoid DMI bottlenecks, allowing for speeds of up to 8700MB/s.
* Intel 760p SSDs are required for the two CPU-attached slots for a RAID 0 setup comprising of three NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs.
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-Series
Powered by NVIDIA Pascal™—the most advanced GPU architecture ever created—the GeForce GTX 10-Series delivers brilliant for AAA titles and virtual reality. 
Anti-Dust Cooling System
The patented Anti-Dust Cooling (ADC) system enables G703 to clean itself of harmful dust and particles. Acting like an immune system, dust, dirt and other particles are ejected from the chassis through two dedicated tunnels via centrifugal force, preventing build-up in the thermal fins to increase system stability and lifespan. Two high-performance, dual-outlet fans blow air through ultra thin fins, while the unique heat-pipe architecture cools the CPU, GPU and chipset power components independently.
XBOX Integration

ROG G703GI - Unleash the Beast
ROG G703 is a beast of a gaming laptop that has the power to take on today’s gaming desktops, thanks to its factory-overclocked 8th Generation Intel® Core™ i7 processor and NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1070 graphics. G703 is the key that unlocks supreme levels of gaming, so you can play AAA games on Ultra graphics settings without compromises. Continually pushing the envelope, ROG has torn up the gaming laptop blueprint, becoming the first to integrate an ultra-responsive IPS-level 144Hz display with a 3ms response time into its laptops. G703 features HyperDrive Extreme storage, which uses exclusive technology to combine three NVMe PCI Express® (PCIe®) SSDs in RAID 0 configuration for read speeds of up to 8700MB/s, so games load up in a blink of an eye.
Performance, Redefined
Simply saying that G703 has gaming desktop levels of performance would be an understatement. It’s powered by a factory-overclocked Intel Core i7-8750H that’s capable of hitting an incredible 4.1GHz — surpassing base speed by more than 10%! Similarly, its NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU and 8GB of GDDR5 VRAM are factory-overclocked as well, and can reach speeds of up to 1683MHz! This graphics prowess lets you enjoy the latest AAA titles at their maxed-out settings for immersive gaming experiences. The ROG-exclusive Gaming Center puts all this performance at your fingertips, with an intuitive dashboard that lets you push G703 to its limits with a mouse click.
HYPERDRIVE EXTREME — WORLD’S FASTEST RAID 0 STORAGE IN A LAPTOP
HyperDrive Extreme uses exclusive technology to combine up to three NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs to provide G703 with the world’s fastest RAID 0 storage available in a gaming laptop — so your games load up faster. Having two out of the three SSDs directly connected to the CPU helps avoid DMI bottlenecks, allowing for speeds of up to 8700MB/s.
* Intel 760p SSDs are required for the two CPU-attached slots for a RAID 0 setup comprising of three NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs.
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-Series
Powered by NVIDIA Pascal™—the most advanced GPU architecture ever created—the GeForce GTX 10-Series delivers brilliant for AAA titles and virtual reality. 
Anti-Dust Cooling System
The patented Anti-Dust Cooling (ADC) system enables G703 to clean itself of harmful dust and particles. Acting like an immune system, dust, dirt and other particles are ejected from the chassis through two dedicated tunnels via centrifugal force, preventing build-up in the thermal fins to increase system stability and lifespan. Two high-performance, dual-outlet fans blow air through ultra thin fins, while the unique heat-pipe architecture cools the CPU, GPU and chipset power components independently.
XBOX Integration
It’s time to break boundaries between gaming platforms. G703 has exclusive Xbox features to offer a combination of unparalleled computing power and gaming console-like convenience.

Measuring just 0.5"" (13.1mm) thin and weighing only 2 pounds, the MacBook is compact yet still has a premium feel, thanks to its unibody design.; The MacBook features a 12"" Retina display with 16:10 aspect ratio and 2304 x 1440 native resolution, which results in 226 pixels per inch (ppi). The display also has 178-wide viewing angles. To deliver the total Retina experience on the MacBook, Apple redesigned the pixels to create a larger aperture, allowing more light to pass through. This enabled Apple to use LED backlighting that's 30 percent more energy efficient than the displays on other Mac notebooks with no loss in brightness.; Inside the MacBook you'll find the 7th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core m3 processor, which is designed with 14-nanometer process technology. This means that the chip is packed with more transistors than the previous generation, for higher density and more efficient performance. Since the Intel Core m3 generates less heat, Apple is able to omit the fan. Instead, the logic board, which is 67% smaller than the one in the 11"" MacBook Air, is seated on top of an anisotropic graphite sheet, which helps disperse any heat that is generated out, to the sides. No fan also means the MacBook will be virtually silent. Even with its miniaturized internal components, the MacBook has an impressive capacity, featuring 8GB of fast, power-efficient 1866 MHz LPDDR3 onboard RAM and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage.; Since the logic board is much smaller and there is no fan, Apple decided to use the remaining space in the MacBook to install a custom battery. The result is 35 percent more battery capacity than before, which adds up to 10 hours of web browsing and up to 12 hours of iTunes movie playback (battery life may vary depending on usage).; In order to maintain its thin and light design, the MacBook features a universal connectivity standard that combines the essential functions you need every day in one dynamic port. The USB Type-C port offers charging, quick USB 3.0 data transfer for connecting to external devices and peripherals, and video output that supports HDMI, VGA, and Mini DisplayPort connections. It is all in a reversible design that's one-third the size of the current USB port.; The Force Touch trackpad features Taptic Engine, which provides a click sensation when you press anywhere on the surface. The sensory capabilities of the Force Touch trackpad allow you to tell your MacBook what you want it to do, based on subtle differences in the amount of pressure you apply as well as providing haptic feedback.; The MacBook also embraces 802.11ac Wi-Fi for fast wireless Internet access. It also has Bluetooth 4.0 technology, which allows you to connect wirelessly to supported peripherals and accessories.",806,EUR

This enabled Apple to use LED backlighting that's 30 percent more energy efficient than the displays on other Mac notebooks with no loss in brightness.; Inside the MacBook you'll find the 7th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core m3 processor, which is designed with 14-nanometer process technology. This means that the chip is packed with more transistors than the previous generation, for higher density and more efficient performance. Since the Intel Core m3 generates less heat, Apple is able to omit the fan. Instead, the logic board, which is 67% smaller than the one in the 11"" MacBook Air, is seated on top of an anisotropic graphite sheet, which helps disperse any heat that is generated out, to the sides. No fan also means the MacBook will be virtually silent. Even with its miniaturized internal components, the MacBook has an impressive capacity, featuring 8GB of fast, power-efficient 1866 MHz LPDDR3 onboard RAM and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage.; Since the logic board is much smaller and there is no fan, Apple decided to use the remaining space in the MacBook to install a custom battery. The result is 35 percent more battery capacity than before, which adds up to 10 hours of web browsing and up to 12 hours of iTunes movie playback (battery life may vary depending on usage).; In order to maintain its thin and light design, the MacBook features a universal connectivity standard that combines the essential functions you need every day in one dynamic port. The USB Type-C port offers charging, quick USB 3.0 data transfer for connecting to external devices and peripherals, and video output that supports HDMI, VGA, and Mini DisplayPort connections. It is all in a reversible design that's one-third the size of the current USB port.; The Force Touch trackpad features Taptic Engine, which provides a click sensation when you press anywhere on the surface. The sensory capabilities of the Force Touch trackpad allow you to tell your MacBook what you want it to do, based on subtle differences in the amount of pressure you apply as well as providing haptic feedback.; The MacBook also embraces 802.11ac Wi-Fi for fast wireless Internet access. It also has Bluetooth 4.0 technology, which allows you to connect wirelessly to supported peripherals and accessories.",806,EUR
